/**
 * LeetCode 127 - Wordã€€Ladder
 * <p>
 * Given two words (beginWord and endWord), and a dictionary's word list, find the length of shortest transformation
 * sequence from beginWord to endWord, such that:
 * <p>
 * Only one letter can be changed at a time.
 * Each transformed word must exist in the word list. Note that beginWord is not a transformed word.
 * <p>
 * Note:
 * Return 0 if there is no such transformation sequence.
 * All words have the same length.
 * All words contain only lowercase alphabetic characters.
 * You may assume no duplicates in the word list.
 * You may assume beginWord and endWord are non-empty and are not the same.
 * <p>
 * Example 1:
 * Input:  beginWord = "hit", endWord = "cog", wordList = ["hot","dot","dog","lot","log","cog"]
 * Output: 5
 * Explanation: As one shortest transformation is "hit" -> "hot" -> "dot" -> "dog" -> "cog", return its length 5.
 * <p>
 * Example 2:
 * Input: beginWord = "hit", endWord = "cog", wordList = ["hot","dot","dog","lot","log"]
 * Output: 0
 * Explanation: The endWord "cog" is not in wordList, therefore no possible transformation.
